<h2>HTTP </h2>
<h5>This particular module provides us with a number of methods that allow us to create server instances
and do other HTTP related tasks.</h5>

<h2>createServer </h2>
<h5>The create server method is part of the HTTP module and as the name implies, it creates an instance of a
server that listens to incoming requests that a user makes and allows us to respond to those requests as needed. Like most methods in Node Js, the CREATE server is asynchronous, which means it doesn't block the JavaScript event loop while it is waiting to respond. </h5>
